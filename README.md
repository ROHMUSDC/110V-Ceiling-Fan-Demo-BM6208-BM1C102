# 110V Ceiling Fan Demo, BM6208 Design Resource Repository
* Hardware Design Files and Documentation for the ROHM 110V Ceiling Fan Demo, BM6208 Demo

----
### Description: 
* The 110V Ceiling Fan Demo retrofits ROHM's BM6208FS 3-Phase Brushless Fan Motor Driver into an existing fan design. 
* Upon completion, the Fan Demo physically shows the benefit of ROHM's solution by reaching a maximum power factor value of 0.96 for this fan reference design.
* This motor driver IC adopts PrestoMOS™ as the output transistor, and put in a small full molding package with the 180° sinusoidal commutation controller chip and the high voltage gate driver chip.
* The protection circuits for overcurrent, overheating, under voltage lock out and the high voltage bootstrap diode with current regulation are built-in. 
* It provides optimum motor drive system and downsizing the built-in PCB of the motor.
